### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: No workflow appears in Actions tab after pushing

**Solutions**:
- Ensure the file is at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (exact path)
- Check file is properly committed and pushed to main branch
- Verify repository has Actions enabled: **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**

#### 2. Permission Denied Error
**Problem**: Workflow fails with permission errors

**Solutions**:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **General**
- Under "Workflow permissions", select **"Read and write permissions"**
- Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

#### 3. Pages Source Not Set
**Problem**: Site not deploying even with successful workflow

**Solutions**:
- Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
- Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
- Click **Save**
- Wait for next push or manually re-run workflow

#### 4. Files Not Found (404)
**Problem**: Site loads but shows 404 for assets

**Solutions**:
- Check all file paths in your HTML are relative (not absolute)
